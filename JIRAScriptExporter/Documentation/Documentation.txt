Purpose of the program:

this program was intended to connect to a JIRA task, download a csv file containing script names
and write the full local path of those files in a txt instruction file.

The proposed workflow is as follow:

1. Connection to an Atlassian JIRA whose link was derived from a cfg file.s
2. If connection is successfully established, the program tries to download the file (the standard for the filename is defined into a cfg file)
3. If the file's download is successfull, the program reads the file names and put them into a List.
4. The program search for those files in a specified directory (from the cfg file) and its subdirectories.
5. When the files are found theyr full path is written in a txt file starting from the line following a line composed only by a $.
